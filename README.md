We are going to make a login screen based on [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/components/text-fields#anatomy) in Adobe XD although the principles can be applied to other programmes such as Figma

Create a sticker sheet of all your colours and components and also select your typography styles and download the icons you wish to use in this project they were selected from the [Material Design icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) (sometimes you might want to create your own using the icon design principle they use in this design system)

Add components to library.

Use a design system/ platform to select your colour scheme here we have use the Google Material Design Colour Tool

Once you have created your components it's a matter of dragging them onto a board (screen) - do we have the layers selected and you can see the hierarchy in the layers outline - we start off with all the header component.

As with the username/email field the password component was added this has the option to total between the text being visible or just a set of dots.

The password field is 238 x 56 pixels
